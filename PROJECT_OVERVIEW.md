# Project Overview: MTG Deckbuilder 

## Summary

This project is a web-based interactive tool designed to help users explore and visualize their preferences in Magic: The Gathering (MTG). The interface is intentionally minimalistic, focusing on an intuitive and engaging user experience.

## Key Features

- **Minimalist UI:** The website has a clean, blank design with a single interactive element: a set of buttons representing MTG colors (e.g., White, Blue, Black, Red, Green).
- **Branching Selection Web:** Users begin by selecting a color. Upon selection, arrows branch out to new, related buttons representing mechanics, cards, archetypes, or other features associated with that color.
- **Recursive Exploration:** Clicking any new button continues the branching process, building an expanding, visual web of interconnected preferences. Each selection deepens the user's personalized MTG web.
- **Dynamic Growth:** The number of new branches created from each selection is determined by a random choice from the list [2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,6], ensuring the exploration remains varied and surprising.
- **Color-Coded Context:** Selections related to a specific color (e.g., green) are visually grouped, making it easy to see the evolution of preferences within each color context.

## Intended User Experience

- The user is prompted with a straightforward choice, making the process accessible and engaging for MTG players of all experience levels.
- The branching web provides immediate visual feedback, encouraging continued exploration and discovery.
- The minimalist design keeps the focus on the branching structure and user choices, reducing distractions and cognitive load.

## Project Goals

- Deliver an intuitive and visually compelling tool for users to map and discover their MTG preferences.
- Emphasize simplicity and exploration, avoiding clutter and unnecessary complexity.
- Build a modular, extensible foundation for future expansion (e.g., more branching topics, integration with card databases, saving/sharing webs).
