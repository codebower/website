# UI and LLM Architecture Details

## Visual Web UI: "Word Web" Interaction

### Goals
- The UI must feel alive, intuitive, and visually compelling.
- Users should experience responsive visual feedback as the web grows with each selection.
- The web should clearly show connections and history.

### Structure
- **Central Node:** The user’s initial choice (e.g., Green) appears as a central node.
- **Branching Nodes:** When a node is clicked, new nodes appear, connected by animated arrows/lines.
- **Animated Growth:** Nodes and connectors should animate into view (fade, slide, expand) to create a sense of discovery and flow.
- **Color Coding:** Each color (or type) uses distinct, consistent colors for nodes/lines.
- **Interactivity:** Nodes are clickable; hovering highlights connections. Previous selections remain interactable for further branching.
- **Zoom & Pan:** If the web grows large, users can drag to pan or use the mouse wheel/two-finger touch to zoom.
- **Clear Labels:** All nodes are easily readable, and selected paths are highlighted for clarity.

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend Rendering:** 
  - Preferably use a Python-friendly framework: 
    - [PyScript](https://pyscript.net/) or [Anvil](https://anvil.works/) for Python-heavy prototyping.
    - For production, likely React (with TypeScript) + [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) or [Cytoscape.js](https://js.cytoscape.org/) for graph rendering and animation, with Python serving data.
- **Styling:** 
  - CSS variables for color consistency. 
  - Use CSS transitions (and/or JS animation libs) for smooth growth and interactivity.

### Inspiration
- LLM-generated “word webs” (GPT-4, Gemini, Claude, etc.).
- Mind-mapping tools (e.g., MindNode, Coggle).
- Data visualization libraries (D3.js, Cytoscape.js).

## LLM API Integration

### Strategy
- **API-Driven Generation:** The LLM (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, or local model) generates branching options in response to user choices.
- **Python as Orchestrator:** All LLM interactions, web state management, and business logic handled in Python.
- **Frontend/Backend Separation:** 
  - Frontend makes API calls to a Python backend for branching suggestions.
  - Backend calls the LLM, processes results, and returns structured data for the UI.

### Architecture
1. **Frontend:** 
   - Displays the web and captures user actions.
   - Sends user choices to backend API.

2. **Backend (Python):**
   - Receives user choice and current path.
   - Calls LLM API (e.g., OpenAI, local model via HuggingFace, etc.) with prompt including context and branching rules.
   - Picks a random number from [2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,6] to determine how many branches to generate.
   - Returns new options and their relationships as structured JSON.
   - Optionally, caches results to avoid duplicate LLM calls and control costs.

3. **LLM Integration:**
   - Use Python SDKs (`openai`, `anthropic`, `transformers`, etc.) for API calls.
   - Prompts should be templated to ensure consistent, relevant, and cost-effective outputs.
   - Optionally, support for local models (e.g., llama.cpp via Python bindings) to further control costs.

### Cost Management
- **Frontload Branching:** Precompute and cache as much of the branching web as possible during setup or first use, so that subsequent user interactions do not require repeated LLM calls.
- **Limit Branch Depth:** Set a maximum branching depth or node count per session.
- **Batch Generation:** For each node, generate multiple branches at once to reduce the total number of API calls.

### Python-First Approach
- Maximize Python in both backend logic and, where practical, for frontend (via PyScript/Anvil or similar tools).
- Use JavaScript only for dynamic UI rendering and animation that cannot be efficiently handled in Python.

## Summary

This architecture ensures a fun, responsive, and visually clear branching web UI, with Python as the controlling logic throughout. All LLM logic and data orchestration happen in Python, ensuring maintainability and extensibility, while cost is managed by precomputing and caching branches.
